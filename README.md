A Pong Clone in JavaScript

This is my attempt at making pong with JavaScript, and it is also the first JavaScript program I have ever made. 
I used factory funcitons to create the paddles and ball, just so I could learn a little bit about that.
This was a fun project, and maybe at some point I will add a main menu or something.
